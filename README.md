# Hack Day 2019

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game where player faces computer. Developed using Visual Studio, C# and Windows Forms.

## The Task

We need you to develop a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.
What the trek?! Don’t worry, it’s an expansion on the classic, made popular by
The Big Bang Theory, just a few additional rules;
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
The program should take a player gesture as input, and using random behaviour
generate a counter gesture, and calculate the winner. Easy! Or is it?? 
## Rules 

There are no rules.
Use any programming language you like, or even one you dislike. If you’re not
confident with a programming language, send us the algorithm you’d use to do
this written in pseudo code.
